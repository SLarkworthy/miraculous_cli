# MiraculousCli

Miraculous Ladybug is a french cartoon that appeals to all ages. Unfortunately, the episodes often get released in bizarre orders. This program allows you to sort episodes by air date or production code, and allows you to type an episode name or production code to get more information about the episode. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'miraculous_cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install miraculous_cli

## Usage

Type bin/miraculous_cli to run!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
